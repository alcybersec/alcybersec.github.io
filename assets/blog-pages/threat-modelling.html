            <p>Most people don’t plan to get hacked — and that’s the problem. We wait until something bad happens to take action. But what if you could understand your personal risks before anything goes wrong? That’s exactly what threat modelling helps you do.</p>
            <p>This article breaks down threat modelling into simple, practical steps that anyone can follow — even if you’re not a cybersecurity expert. You’ll learn how to identify what’s valuable, understand what might go wrong, and take focused steps to protect your digital life.</p>

            <h3>What is Threat Modelling?</h3>
            <p>Threat modelling is the process of thinking about what could go wrong and how to prevent it. It’s like doing a security audit for your digital life. In tech companies, it’s used to design secure systems. But on a personal level, it helps you figure out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What you want to protect</li>
                <li>Who might try to access or damage it</li>
                <li>How they might do it</li>
                <li>What you can do to stop them</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The goal is not to become paranoid. It’s to make smart, realistic choices that match your lifestyle and risks.</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Define What You’re Protecting</h3>
            <p>The first step is identifying what matters to you. This can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal data (photos, emails, ID documents)</li>
                <li>Financial access (bank accounts, credit cards)</li>
                <li>Online identity (social media, emails)</li>
                <li>Location data (home address, travel habits)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Everyone’s digital footprint is different. If you’re a journalist, you might need to protect your sources. If you’re a parent, it could be your children’s privacy. Make a quick list of the digital assets you care about most.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Know Your Threats</h3>
            <p>A "threat" is anything that could harm your data, privacy, or safety. Common personal-level threats include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hackers trying to steal your login credentials</li>
                <li>Phishing attacks via email or social media</li>
                <li>Government surveillance (especially in authoritarian countries)</li>
                <li>Data brokers collecting and selling your info</li>
                <li>Stalkers or ex-partners abusing digital access</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think about who might want your data and why. Your threat model is unique to you. Most people aren’t targeted by advanced hackers — but nearly everyone is a target for scams and data harvesting.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Understand Your Vulnerabilities</h3>
            <p>Now ask yourself: How could someone reach your data or systems? These are your vulnerabilities. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reusing weak passwords across sites</li>
                <li>Using unencrypted messaging apps</li>
                <li>Leaving your phone unlocked</li>
                <li>Clicking on suspicious links</li>
                <li>Oversharing on social media</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Make a note of where you might be exposed. You don’t need to fix everything — just the things that matter most, based on your threats and what you’re protecting.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Prioritize and Take Action</h3>
            <p>Now you put it all together. Combine your list of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities, and ask: What are the most likely and most harmful scenarios?</p>
            <p>For example, if you use the same password for your email and social media accounts, and a hacker gains access, they could lock you out or impersonate you. Fixing this (by using unique passwords and enabling 2FA) is a high-impact step.</p>
            <p>Start with the changes that give you the biggest improvement for the least effort. These are usually:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using a password manager</li>
                <li>Turning on two-factor authentication</li>
                <li>Keeping devices and apps updated</li>
                <li>Limiting personal info shared online</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 5: Review and Adjust Regularly</h3>
            <p>Your threat model isn’t static. Life changes. Maybe you start a new job, travel to another country, or experience a breakup. Each of these might shift your priorities or introduce new risks.</p>
            <p>It’s a good idea to review your digital security every 6-12 months. You don’t need a full spreadsheet — just ask yourself what’s changed, and whether your defenses still match your needs.</p>

            <h3>Example: A Simple Threat Model in Action</h3>
            <p>Let’s say Sarah is a freelance writer. Her main digital assets are her work documents, email, and client contacts. Her threats include phishing, accidental leaks, and data loss.</p>
            <p>After threat modelling, she:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Switches to a password manager</li>
                <li>Turns on 2FA for all important accounts</li>
                <li>Migrates her writing to encrypted cloud storage with version control</li>
                <li>Starts backing up her data weekly to an external hard drive</li>
                <li>Decides not to post real-time travel updates on social media</li>
            </ul>
            <p>None of this is overly technical — but it dramatically reduces her risk.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Threat modelling isn’t just for cybersecurity professionals. It’s for anyone who values their privacy and digital safety. By thinking ahead, you can take control of your online world — instead of waiting for disaster to strike.</p>
            <p>You don’t need to fix everything at once. Just start with awareness, make a few small changes, and build from there. The more you understand your own risks, the easier it becomes to protect what matters.</p>
